# CocoaLibSpotify #

CocoaLibSpotify is an Objective-C wrapper around our libspotify library. It provides easy access to libspotify's features in a friendly, KVC/O compliant Objective-C wrapper.

CocoaLibSpotify requires libspotify.framework, which isn't included in the repository. The Mac Framework and iOS Library  Xcode projects include a build step to download and unpack it from developer.spotify.com automatically. If this fails for some reason, download it manually from developer.spotify.com and unpack it into the project folder.

## Release Notes ##

You can find the latest release notes in the [CHANGELOG.markdown](https://github.com/spotify/cocoalibspotify/blob/master/CHANGELOG.markdown) file.

## A Note On "Loading" ##

CocoaLibSpotify does a lot of asynchronous loading â€” tracks, playlists, artists, albums, etc can all finish loading their metadata after you get an object. In the case of user playlists and searching, this can be a number of seconds.

Do *not* poll these properties. CocoaLibSpotify does a lot of work in the main runloop, and when you do a polling loop you can, in many cases, stop CocoaLibSpotify's ability to do any work, causing the metadata to never load.

Instead, CocoaLibSpotify's properties are Key-Value Observing compliant, and the best practice is to add an observer to the properties you're interested in to receive a notification callback when the metadata is loaded.

For example, if you want to know when search results come back, add an observer like this:

    [self addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"search.tracks" options:0 context:nil];
    self.search = [SPSearch searchWithSearchQuery:@"Hello" inSession:[SPSession sharedSession]];

When the tracks in the search are updated, you'll get a callback:


    - (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    
    	if ([keyPath isEqualToString:@"search.tracks"])
    		NSLog(@"Search found tracks: %@", self.search.tracks);
    }

Most objects also have a generic `loaded` or similar property that you can observe for general callbacks about when objects are loaded.

Key-Value Observing is a core technology in the Mac and iOS SDKs, and extensive documentation and examples can be found in Apple's [developer documentation](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/KVO.html).

## Building -  Mac OS X ##

The Xcode project requires Xcode 4.3 and Mac OS X 10.7 to build since it uses ARC. However, the built binary can be deployed on 64-bit systems running Mac OS X 10.6 or higher.

The built CocoaLibSpotify.framework contains libspotify.framework as a child framework. Sometimes, Xcode gives build errors complaining it can't find <libspotify/api.h>. If you get this, manually add the directory libspotify.framework is in to your project's "Framework Search Paths" build setting. For example, if you're building the CocoaLibSpotify project alongside your application as an embedded Xcode project then copying it into your bundle, you'd have this:

`$CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR/CocoaLibSpotify.framework/Versions/Frameworks`

Otherwise, you'd point to the downloaded libspotify.framework manually, something like this:

`../../libspotify-11.1.56-Darwin-universal`

## Building - iOS ##

The Xcode project requires Xcode 4.3 and iOS SDK version 5.0+ to build since it uses ARC. However, the built binary can be deployed on any iOS version from version 4.0.

The built libCocoaLibSpotify contains libspotify internally as a static library, as well as all of the required header files in a directory called "include".

In addition, you MUST include SPLoginResources.bundle as a resource of your application.

When including libCocoaLibSpotify in your application, you must also link to the following frameworks:

- SystemConfiguration.framework
- CFNetwork.framework
- libstdc++
- CoreAudio.framework
- AudioToolbox.framework
- AVFoundation.framework

In addition, you must add the following two items to the "Other Linker Flags" build setting:

- -all_load
- -ObjC

If you're building the CocoaLibSpotify project alongside your application as an embedded Xcode project then linking it with your application in a build step, you can tell Xcode where the header files are by adding the following setting to the "Framework Search Paths" build setting of your project:

`$CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR/include`

Otherwise, you can simply add all of the header files to your project manually. 

Once everything is set up, simply import the following header to get started with CocoaLibSpotify!

`#import "CocoaLibSpotify.h"`

## Documentation ##

The headers of CocoaLibSpotify are well documented, and we've provided an Xcode DocSet to provide documentation right in Xcode. With these and the sample projects, you should have everything you need to dive right in!
